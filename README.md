Uses Pandas and matplotlib python library to take a csv file of banking transactions and parse them into a bar graph. Organized by Category and produces summary of total transactions under each category

I wrote this a small side project to explore the pandas library. Even though many banks probably have this feature, I figured it would be good for learning as well as notifications with ntfy. Currently I have a script to produce the bar graph, export as an image, then pushes the image with a notification to my phone periodically.
